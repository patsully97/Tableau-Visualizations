# Tableau-Visualizations
The attached file includes some simple charts that I used to visualize data from an Excel dataset.

The visualizations included in the worksheets are a bar chart, a line chart, and a table.

I included a dashboard to incorporate these visualizations into one, interactive display.

On the dashboard, I added dropdowns for the user to choose the information displayed by the charts.

If unable to download the file, you can view the dashboard on my Tableau Public profile with the below link:
